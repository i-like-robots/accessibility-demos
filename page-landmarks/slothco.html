						Sloths
					</h1>
					<p>
						Sloths are medium-sized mammals belonging to the families Megalonychidae (two-toed
						sloth) and Bradypodidae (three-toed sloth), classified into six species. They are
						part of the order Pilosa and are therefore related to anteaters, which sport a
						similar set of specialized claws. Extant sloths are arboreal (tree-dwelling)
						residents of the jungles of Central and South America, and are known for being
						slow-moving, and hence named "sloths". Extinct sloth species include many ground
						sloths, some of which attained the size of elephants.

					<h2>
						Ecology
					</h2>
					<p>
						Sloths are classified as folivores, as the bulk of their diets consist of buds, tender shoots, and
						leaves, mainly of Cecropia trees. Some two-toed sloths have been documented as eating insects, small
						reptiles, and birds as a small supplement to their diets. Linnaeus's two-toed sloth has recently been
						documented eating human faeces from open latrines. They have made extraordinary adaptations to an
						arboreal browsing lifestyle. Leaves, their main food source, provide very little energy or nutrients,
						and do not digest easily. Sloths, therefore, have large, specialized, slow-acting stomachs with
						multiple compartments in which symbiotic bacteria break down the tough leaves. Sloths' tongues have the
						unique ability to protrude from their mouths 10 to 12 inches, an ability that is useful for collecting
						leaves just out of reach. As much as two-thirds of a well-fed sloth's body weight consists of the
						contents of its stomach, and the digestive process can take a month or more to complete.

					<h2>
						Physiology
					</h2>
					<p>
						Sloth fur exhibits specialized functions: the outer hairs grow in a direction opposite from that of other
						mammals. In most mammals, hairs grow toward the extremities, but because sloths spend so much time with
						their legs above their bodies, their hairs grow away from the extremities to provide protection from the
						elements while the sloth hangs upside down. In most conditions, the fur hosts two species of symbiotic
						cyanobacteria, which provide camouflage. Because of the cyanobacteria, sloth fur is a small
						ecosystem of its own, hosting many species of non-parasitic insects. Sloths have short, flat heads, big
						eyes; short snouts, long legs, and tiny ears. Some species have stubby tails (6â€“7 cm long). Altogether,
						sloths' bodies usually are between 50 and 60 cm long.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sloths' claws serve as their only natural defense. A cornered sloth may swipe at its attackers in an effort
						to scare them away or wound them. Despite sloths' apparent defenselessness, predators do not pose special
						problems: sloths blend in with the trees and, moving only slowly, do not attract attention. Only during
						their infrequent visits to ground level do they become vulnerable. The main predators of sloths are the
						jaguar, the harpy eagle, and humans. The majority of recorded sloth deaths in Costa Rica are due to contact
						with electrical lines and poachers. Their claws also provide a further unexpected deterrent to human
						hunters; when hanging upside-down in a tree, they are held in place by the claws themselves and often do
						not fall down even if shot from below.
