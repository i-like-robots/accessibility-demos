						The domestic cat is a small, usually furry, domesticated, and carnivorous mammal.
						It is often called the housecat when kept as an indoor pet, or simply the cat when
						there is no need to distinguish it from other felids and felines. Cats are often
						valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt vermin and household
						pests.

					<p>
						The domestic dog is the 31,000 year old descendant of a now extinct European Wolf
						and a member of the Canidae family of the mammalian order Carnivora. The term
						"domestic dog" is generally used for both domesticated and feral varieties. The dog
						was the first domesticated animal and has been the most widely kept working, hunting,
						and pet animal in human history. The word "dog" can also refer to the male of a canine
						species, as opposed to the word "bitch" which refers to the female of the species.

					<p>
						Sloths are medium-sized mammals belonging to the families Megalonychidae (two-toed
						sloth) and Bradypodidae (three-toed sloth), classified into six species. They are
						part of the order Pilosa and are therefore related to anteaters, which sport a
						similar set of specialized claws. Extant sloths are arboreal (tree-dwelling)
						residents of the jungles of Central and South America, and are known for being
						slow-moving, and hence named "sloths". Extinct sloth species include many ground
						sloths, some of which attained the size of elephants.
